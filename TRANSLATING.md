# Guide for translators of the Minimum Viable CD

In case you want to translate this manifest, follow these guidelines:

1. Translating the full text of the manifest itself is the minimum viable translation. The FAQ is subject to change more frequently and is optional to translate as long as the links then point to the English version. The list of resources is not going to be maintained in several languages.
2. Use common language easily understood by a student of software engineering or a stakeholder working with engineers.
3. If the terms have been translated to the target language before, prefer them over mixing with English and the target language.
4. Replace the bottom of the front page starting from the Signatories with the translated version of this page starting from under the horizontal rule.
5. Update the commit hash and timestamp to the "Translation" subsection. This should make version drift between languages apparent to the reader.
6. Get a peer review side by side from someone who reads both languages fluently and is preferably a native user of the target language.
7. If viable, get a peer review of the translated text from someone who has not read the English text for clarity.
8. Translating the quote from Accelerate is optional if the book has not been translated into the target language. If you translate it yourself, mark it with `(Unofficial translation)`
9. All translations must be stored under a directory named with the ISO 639-1 language code and the file names the same as the originals (even though FAQ does not mean anything in most languages). Example: se/README.md and se/FAQ.md for Northern Sami.
10. Send a pull request that updates the list of translations for navigation. (at the time of writing this document, no such thing exists and will be sorted out then)

## Signatories

The signatories have signed the [original English version](/#signatories) and the current list of names is published only with that version.

## Translation

This translation is a community effort in order to help pass this information beyond language barriers. The signatories themselves cannot confirm the correctness of the translation.
